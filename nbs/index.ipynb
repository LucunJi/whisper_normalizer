    "## Why should we normalize/standardize text?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In ASR systems it's important to normalize the text to reduce error in metrics like WER, CER etc.\n",
    "- Text normalization/standardization is process of converting texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.(from [Whisper paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use this python package?\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is a python implementation of the text standardisation/normalization approach which is being used in OpenAI whisper text normalizer. If you want to use just text normalization alone, it's better to use this\n",
    "instead reimplementing the same thing. OpenAI approach of text normalization is very helpful and is being used as normalization step when evaluating competitive models like [AssemblyAI Conformer-1 model](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/conformer-1/).\n",

    "## Models evaluated using Whisper normalization\n",

    "- Conformer 1 by AssemblyAI\n",
